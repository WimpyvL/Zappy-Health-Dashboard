- **Notification System**: Sends welcome, confirmation, and status notifications
- **Patient Tagging**: Applies appropriate tags based on patient journey and category

### 2. Updated Intake Form Integration
**File:** `src/pages/intake/IntakeFormPage.jsx`

The intake form now uses the comprehensive service for:
- Seamless patient account creation (authenticated and public forms)
- Automatic consultation generation
- Order creation for selected treatments
- Invoice generation
- Progress tracking and error handling

### 3. Enhanced Form Steps
All intake form steps have been updated with:
- **Telehealth Flow Tracking**: Complete journey tracking from start to finish

- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error tracking and recovery
- **Category-Specific Logic**: Tailored experiences for different treatment categories

#### Updated Steps:
- `src/pages/intake/steps/BasicInfoStep.jsx`
- `src/pages/intake/steps/HealthHistoryStep.jsx`
- `src/pages/intake/steps/TreatmentPreferencesStep.jsx`
- `src/pages/intake/steps/ReviewStep.jsx`

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Patient Account Creation
- **Authenticated Users**: Links intake to existing patient records
- **Public Forms**: Creates new patient accounts without authentication
- **Data Extraction**: Intelligently extracts patient information from form data
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Checks for existing patients before creating new records

### 2. Medical Information Processing
- **Chief Complaint Generation**: Automatically generates chief complaints based on category and form data
- **Medical History Extraction**: Processes and formats medical history information
- **Medication Tracking**: Records current medications and allergies
- **Category-Specific Processing**: Tailored processing for weight management, ED, hair loss, etc.

### 3. Order and Invoice Management
- **Product Selection**: Links selected treatments to orders
- **Pricing Integration**: Automatically calculates order totals
- **Invoice Generation**: Creates invoices for pending orders
- **Status Tracking**: Maintains order and invoice status throughout the process

### 4. Notification System
- **Welcome Messages**: Sends welcome notifications to new patients
- **Consultation Confirmations**: Notifies patients when consultations are received
- **Order Confirmations**: Confirms order placement and status
- **Provider Notifications**: Alerts providers of new consultations requiring review

### 5. Patient Tagging System
Automatically applies relevant tags based on:
- **Treatment Category**: `category_weight_management`, `category_ed`, etc.
- **Patient Status**: `new_patient`, `has_order`, `consultation_only`
- **Journey Stage**: `intake_completed`, `pending_approval`

## Database Integration

The service integrates with the following database tables:
- `patients` - Patient account information
- `form_submissions` - Complete intake form data
- `consultations` - Medical consultation records
- `orders` - Treatment orders
- `order_items` - Individual order line items
- `pb_invoices` - Invoice records
- `patient_notifications` - Patient notification history
- `tags` - Tag definitions
- `patient_tags` - Patient tag associations

## Error Handling and Resilience

### Comprehensive Error Management
- **Database Errors**: Proper error handling for all database operations
- **Validation Errors**: Form validation with user-friendly error messages
- **Network Errors**: Graceful handling of network connectivity issues
- **Partial Failures**: Continues processing even if non-critical operations fail

### Logging and Monitoring
- **Console Logging**: Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Performance Tracking**: Measures and logs performance metrics
- **Error Tracking**: Records errors with context for troubleshooting

## Flow Tracking Integration

### Telehealth Flow Tracker
- **Journey Mapping**: Tracks complete patient journey from intake to consultation
- **Stage Recording**: Records each stage of the intake process
- **Performance Metrics**: Measures time spent on each step
- **Error Tracking**: Records and categorizes errors throughout the flow

### Analytics Integration
- **Flow Analytics**: Provides insights into patient journey patterns
- **Conversion Tracking**: Measures conversion rates at each step
- **Performance Monitoring**: Identifies bottlenecks and optimization opportunities

## Testing and Validation

### Form Validation
- **Required Fields**: Validates all required information is provided
- **Data Format**: Ensures proper data formatting and types
- **Business Rules**: Applies category-specific validation rules

### Integration Testing
- **End-to-End Flow**: Tests complete flow from form submission to consultation creation
- **Error Scenarios**: Tests error handling and recovery mechanisms
- **Performance Testing**: Validates performance under various conditions

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Provider Dashboard Integration**: Connect consultations to provider workflow
2. **Consultation Review Process**: Implement provider review and approval workflow
3. **Order Processing**: Complete order fulfillment and tracking
4. **Invoice Processing**: Implement payment processing and invoice management

### Future Enhancements
1. **AI Integration**: Implement AI-powered consultation analysis
2. **Advanced Analytics**: Enhanced reporting and analytics capabilities
3. **Mobile Optimization**: Mobile-specific optimizations and features
4. **Real-time Updates**: Real-time status updates and notifications

## Configuration and Deployment

### Environment Variables
