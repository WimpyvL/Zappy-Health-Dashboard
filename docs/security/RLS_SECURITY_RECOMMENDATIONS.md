# CRITICAL: Row Level Security (RLS) Policy Security Issues

## SECURITY VULNERABILITIES IDENTIFIED

### 1. Overly Broad RLS Policies
**File:** `supabase-table-fix.md` (lines 81-82, 85-86)

**Current Problematic Policies:**
```sql
-- SECURITY RISK: These policies are TOO PERMISSIVE
Policy definition: `true` (allows ANY authenticated user to read/write)
```

**CRITICAL IMPACT:**
- Any authenticated user can access ANY patient's subscription data
- No data isolation between patients
- Violates HIPAA/healthcare data protection requirements
- Allows unauthorized access to sensitive medical billing information

## REQUIRED SECURITY FIXES

### 1. Patient Data Access Control
Replace the overly broad `true` policies with proper access controls:

#### For `patient_subscription` table:
```sql
-- READ POLICY: Users can only read their own subscription data
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own subscriptions" ON patient_subscription
FOR SELECT USING (
  patient_id = (SELECT id FROM patients WHERE user_id = auth.uid())
);

-- WRITE POLICY: Users can only modify their own subscription data
CREATE POLICY "Users can modify own subscriptions" ON patient_subscription
FOR ALL USING (
  patient_id = (SELECT id FROM patients WHERE user_id = auth.uid())
);
```

#### For `treatment_package` table:
```sql
-- READ POLICY: All authenticated users can view available packages
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can view packages" ON treatment_package
FOR SELECT USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated' AND is_active = true);

-- WRITE POLICY: Only admins can modify packages
CREATE POLICY "Only admins can modify packages" ON treatment_package
FOR ALL USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM profiles 
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
    AND role IN ('admin', 'provider')
  )
);
```

#### For `subscription_duration` table:
```sql
-- READ POLICY: All authenticated users can view durations
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can view durations" ON subscription_duration
FOR SELECT USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- WRITE POLICY: Only admins can modify durations
CREATE POLICY "Only admins can modify durations" ON subscription_duration
FOR ALL USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM profiles 
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
    AND role IN ('admin', 'provider')
  )
);
```

### 2. Role-Based Access Control
Ensure proper role validation in all RLS policies:

```sql
-- Example role check function for reuse
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION is_admin_or_provider()
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM profiles 
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
    AND role IN ('admin', 'provider')
  );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

### 3. Patient Data Isolation
Ensure all patient-related tables have proper isolation:

```sql
-- Example pattern for patient data tables
CREATE POLICY "Users access own data only" ON [patient_table]
FOR ALL USING (
  -- For patients: only their own data
  (patient_id = (SELECT id FROM patients WHERE user_id = auth.uid()))
  OR
  -- For providers/admins: access to assigned patients only
  (EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM profiles 
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
    AND role IN ('admin', 'provider')
  ))
);
```

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

1. **STOP using `true` policies immediately** - they expose all data
2. **Audit all existing RLS policies** across all tables
3. **Implement proper role-based access control**
4. **Test policies thoroughly** with different user roles
5. **Document all security changes** for compliance

## COMPLIANCE CONSIDERATIONS

- **HIPAA Compliance:** Current policies violate patient data protection
- **Data Privacy:** No proper data isolation between users
- **Audit Trail:** Need logging for sensitive data access
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant minimum necessary access only

## TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Create test users with different roles
2. Verify data isolation between patients
3. Test provider access to assigned patients only
4. Ensure admin access is properly restricted
5. Test with unauthenticated users (should be denied)

## MONITORING

Implement monitoring for:
- Failed authentication attempts
- Unauthorized data access attempts
- Policy violations
- Unusual data access patterns
