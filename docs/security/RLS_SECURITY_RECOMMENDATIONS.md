# CRITICAL: Firestore Security Rule Recommendations

## SECURITY VULNERABILITIES IDENTIFIED

### 1. Overly Broad Security Rules
**File:** `firestore.rules` (example from previous analysis)

**Current Problematic Policies:**
```
// SECURITY RISK: Example of an overly permissive rule
match /patient_subscription/{docId} {
  allow read, write: if true; // Allows ANY authenticated user
}
```

**CRITICAL IMPACT:**
- Any authenticated user could access ANY patient's subscription data.
- No data isolation between patients.
- Violates HIPAA/healthcare data protection requirements.
- Allows unauthorized access to sensitive medical billing information.

## REQUIRED SECURITY FIXES

### 1. Patient Data Access Control
Replace overly broad rules with proper access controls based on user UID and roles.

#### For `patient_subscription` collection:
```
// READ POLICY: Users can only read their own subscription data.
// WRITE POLICY: Users can only modify their own subscription data.
match /patient_subscription/{subscriptionId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.patientId || isProviderOrAdminForPatient(resource.data.patientId);
}
```

#### For `treatment_package` collection:
```
// READ POLICY: All authenticated users can view available packages.
// WRITE POLICY: Only admins/providers can modify packages.
match /treatment_package/{packageId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null && resource.data.is_active == true;
  allow write: if hasRole(['admin', 'provider']);
}
```

#### For `subscription_duration` collection:
```
// READ POLICY: All authenticated users can view durations.
// WRITE POLICY: Only admins/providers can modify durations.
match /subscription_duration/{durationId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null;
  allow write: if hasRole(['admin', 'provider']);
}
```

### 2. Role-Based Access Control Functions
Define reusable functions in your `firestore.rules` file to check user roles. This requires storing roles in Firestore or as custom claims in Firebase Auth.

```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    
    // Function to check user role from a 'users' collection
    function hasRole(allowedRoles) {
      return get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role in allowedRoles;
    }

    // Function to check if a provider is assigned to a patient
    function isProviderOrAdminForPatient(patientId) {
      let userRole = get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role;
      // This is a simplified check. A real implementation would query an assignments collection.
      return userRole == 'admin' || userRole == 'provider'; 
    }
    
    // Apply these functions in your match blocks
    // ... your rules here
  }
}
```

### 3. Patient Data Isolation
Ensure all collections containing Patient Health Information (PHI) are protected with strict rules.

```
// Example pattern for patient data collections
match /medical_records/{recordId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.patientId 
                      || (hasRole(['provider', 'admin']) && isProviderOrAdminForPatient(resource.data.patientId));
}
```

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

1.  **STOP using insecure default rules** (like `allow read, write: if true;` or `if request.auth != null;` for sensitive data).
2.  **Audit all existing Firestore security rules**.
3.  **Implement proper role-based access control** using functions and user profile data.
4.  **Test policies thoroughly** with different user roles using the Firebase Emulator Suite.
5.  **Document all security changes** for compliance.

## COMPLIANCE CONSIDERATIONS

- **HIPAA Compliance:** Current example policies would violate patient data protection. The recommended changes are essential for compliance.
- **Data Privacy:** Proper data isolation between users is mandatory.
- **Audit Trail:** Use Cloud Functions triggered by Firestore writes to create an audit trail of data access.
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant the minimum necessary access for each role.

## TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS

1.  Set up the Firebase Emulator Suite locally.
2.  Create test users with different roles ('patient', 'provider', 'admin').
3.  Write unit tests for your security rules to verify:
    *   Data isolation between patients.
    *   Provider access is limited to assigned patients.
    *   Admin access rules are correct.
    *   Unauthenticated users are denied access.

## MONITORING

Implement monitoring for:
-   Failed authentication attempts (Firebase Auth logs).
-   Security rule denials (Firestore logs in Google Cloud).
-   Unusual data access patterns.
