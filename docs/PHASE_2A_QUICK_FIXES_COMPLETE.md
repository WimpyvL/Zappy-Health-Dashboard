# Phase 2A: Quick Code Fixes - COMPLETE

## Summary
Successfully implemented critical fixes for the most urgent issues identified in the user feedback.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Pharmacy Management - Database Schema Mismatch
**Issue**: "Error updating pharmacy: Could not find the 'contact_email' column of 'pharmacies' in the schema cache"

**Root Cause**: The API hooks were trying to use `contact_email` column but the database schema only has `email` column.

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `src/apis/pharmacies/hooks.js`
- Mapped form's `contact_email` field to database's `email` column in both create and update operations
- Fixed toggle pharmacy status function to work with correct parameter structure

**Files Modified**:
- `src/apis/pharmacies/hooks.js`

### 2. ✅ Discount Management - Form Validation
**Issue**: "Currently, it's possible to create a discount without a name, code, or a valid percentage (e.g., 0%). This shouldn't be allowed."

**Root Cause**: Missing form validation in the discount creation/update process.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added comprehensive validation to `handleSubmit` function in `src/pages/discounts/DiscountManagement.jsx`
- Validates required fields: name, code, value, valid_from date
- Ensures discount value is greater than 0
- Ensures percentage discounts don't exceed 100%
- Provides user-friendly error messages via toast notifications

**Validation Rules Added**:
- Name and code are required fields
- Discount value must be greater than 0
- Percentage discount cannot exceed 100%
- Valid from date is required

**Files Modified**:
- `src/pages/discounts/DiscountManagement.jsx`

## Next Steps
Continue with Phase 2B to address the remaining critical issues:
- Task Management "Add Task" button functionality
- Provider Management "Add Provider" button functionality  
- Orders "Create Order" medication/product loading issues
- Sessions search and filtering error handling
- Patient messaging functionality
- Form submission and dynamic templates

## Impact
These fixes resolve two critical database-related errors that were preventing users from:
1. Managing pharmacy records (adding/editing pharmacies)
2. Creating invalid discount records that could cause system inconsistencies

Both fixes improve data integrity and user experience by providing proper validation and error handling.
