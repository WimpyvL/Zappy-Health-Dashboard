## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js** (version 16 or higher)
2. **Playwright** browser automation framework
3. **Running Zappy Dashboard application**

### Installation

1. Install Playwright and dependencies:
```bash
npm install @playwright/test
npx playwright install
```

2. Verify Playwright configuration:
```bash
# Check existing playwright.config.js
npx playwright test --dry-run
```

3. Ensure application is running:
```bash
# Start the Zappy Dashboard application
npm run start
# Application should be available at http://localhost:3000
```

### Environment Configuration

1. **Test User Setup**: Ensure test users exist in your database:
   - `test@zappydashboard.com` (standard user)
   - `admin@zappydashboard.com` (admin user)

2. **Database State**: Apply all database migrations before testing:
```bash
# Apply the comprehensive database fixes
supabase migration up
```

3. **Environment Variables**: Set up test environment variables if needed:
```bash
# .env.test
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_key
```

## Running Tests

pipeline {
    agent any
    
    stages {
        stage('Setup') {
            steps {
                sh 'npm ci'
                sh 'npx playwright install'
            }

            publishHTML([
                allowMissing: false,
                alwaysLinkToLastBuild: true,
                keepAll: true,
                reportDir: 'test-reports',
                reportFiles: 'e2e-test-report.html',
                reportName: 'E2E Test Report'
            ])
        }
    }
}
```

## Configuration Options

### Playwright Configuration (`playwright.config.js`)
```javascript
module.exports = defineConfig({
  testDir: './playwright-tests',
  timeout: 60 * 1000,
  fullyParallel: false,
  retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 1,
  workers: process.env.CI ? 1 : 1,
  
  use: {
    baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
    trace: 'on-first-retry',
    screenshot: 'only-on-failure',
    video: 'retain-on-failure'
  },
  
  projects: [
    {
      name: 'chromium',
      use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] }
    },
    {
      name: 'firefox',
      use: { ...devices['Desktop Firefox'] }
    },
    {
      name: 'webkit',
      use: { ...devices['Desktop Safari'] }
    }
  ]
});
```

### Test Runner Configuration
The test runner can be configured by modifying the `config` object in `e2e-test-runner.js`:

```javascript
this.config = {
  outputDir: 'test-results',
  reportDir: 'test-reports',
  maxRetries: 2,
  timeoutPerSuite: 600000, // 10 minutes
  browsers: ['chromium'],
  parallel: false,
  headless: true
};
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Application Not Starting
```bash
# Check if port 3000 is available
lsof -ti:3000

# Kill any existing processes
kill -9 $(lsof -ti:3000)

# Start application
npm start
```

#### 2. Test Authentication Failures
- Ensure test users exist in database
- Verify Supabase credentials are correct
- Check if RLS policies allow test user access

#### 3. Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Check Supabase status
supabase status

# Reset local database if needed
supabase db reset
```

#### 4. Browser Launch Failures
```bash
# Reinstall Playwright browsers
npx playwright install --force

# Check system dependencies
npx playwright install-deps
```

### Debug Mode

#### Run Tests in Debug Mode
```bash
# Debug specific test
npx playwright test playwright-tests/comprehensive-e2e-tests.js --debug

# Run with headed browser
npx playwright test --headed

# Run with slow motion
npx playwright test --headed --slowMo=1000
```

#### Enable Verbose Logging
```bash
# Set debug environment variable
DEBUG=pw:api npx playwright test

# Enable trace viewer
npx playwright show-trace test-results/trace.zip
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Test Data Management
- Use isolated test data that doesn't conflict with production
- Clean up test data after each test run
- Use unique identifiers (timestamps, UUIDs) for test records

### 2. Page Object Pattern
- Create reusable page objects for complex interactions
- Centralize element selectors in page objects
- Implement common actions as methods

### 3. Waiting Strategies
- Use `waitForLoadState('networkidle')` for full page loads
- Wait for specific elements rather than fixed timeouts
- Implement custom wait conditions for complex scenarios

### 4. Error Handling
- Take screenshots on failures for debugging
- Log detailed error information
- Implement retry mechanisms for flaky tests

### 5. Test Maintenance
- Review and update tests when UI changes
- Keep test selectors stable using data-testid attributes
- Regular cleanup of obsolete tests

## Performance Considerations

### Test Execution Speed
- Run tests in parallel when possible
- Use shared authentication state to avoid repeated logins
- Implement smart test ordering (critical tests first)

### Resource Management
- Limit concurrent browser instances
- Clean up resources after each test
- Monitor memory usage during long test runs

### Reporting Optimization
- Generate lightweight reports for CI/CD
- Store detailed reports for debugging
- Implement report archival for historical analysis

## Integration with Database Fixes

This E2E testing framework specifically validates the database fixes implemented for:

### Follow-up Consultation System
- Tests creation of follow-up consultation notes
- Validates proper RPC function execution
- Ensures data integrity across consultation workflows

### Session Management
- Validates session type handling
- Tests session creation and modification
- Ensures proper consultation linking

### Patient Service Enrollment
- Tests complete enrollment workflows
- Validates subscription management
- Ensures proper billing integration

### Order Processing
- Tests end-to-end order workflows
- Validates inventory management
- Ensures proper status tracking

## Support and Maintenance

### Regular Maintenance Tasks
1. **Weekly**: Review test results and fix flaky tests
2. **Monthly**: Update test data and scenarios
3. **Quarterly**: Review test coverage and add new scenarios
4. **After releases**: Update tests for new features

### Getting Help
- Check the troubleshooting section for common issues
- Review Playwright documentation for advanced features
- Contact the development team for application-specific issues

### Contributing
- Follow existing test patterns when adding new tests
- Document any new test utilities or helpers
- Ensure tests are deterministic and reliable
