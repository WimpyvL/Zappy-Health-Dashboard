# Block-Based Note Generation System Implementation Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive block-based note generation system with role-based visibility for the telehealth platform. This system replaces the previous monolithic template approach with a modular, flexible architecture that provides different views for providers and patients.

## üéØ Key Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Enhancement
- **Template Blocks Table**: Modular note sections with configurable visibility rules
- **Template Compositions Table**: Defines which blocks make up each template
- **Patient Note Views Table**: Tracks patient viewing behavior
- **Role-Based Functions**: Database functions for filtering content by user role

### 2. Block Types Supported
- `patient_history` - Medical history summaries
- `medications` - Medication lists and instructions
- `assessment_plan` - Clinical assessments (provider-only)
- `communication` - Patient messages and follow-up instructions
- `ai_panel` - AI generation tools (provider-only)
- `alert_center` - Clinical alerts and warnings (provider-only)
- `service_panel` - Service management tools
- `treatment_progress` - Progress tracking (patient-friendly)
- `follow_up_instructions` - Next steps and guidance
- `custom` - Custom content blocks

### 3. Visibility Rules
- **Provider Only**: Never shown to patients (clinical assessments, AI tools, alerts)
- **Patient Friendly**: Filtered version shown to patients (simplified language, key info only)
- **Shared**: Same content for both roles (general instructions, communication)

### 4. Role-Aware Components
Enhanced existing consultation note components with `viewMode` prop:
- `PatientHistoryCard` - Shows simplified read-only history for patients
- Provider view maintains full editing and AI generation capabilities
- Patient view shows clean, professional summary without clinical jargon

    'consultation-id-here', 
    'patient'
);

-- Test template processing
SELECT process_block_based_template(
    'template-id-here',
    'consultation-id-here', 
    'provider'
);
```

### Component Testing
```jsx
// Test provider view
<PatientHistoryCard viewMode="provider" {...props} />

// Test patient view
<PatientHistoryCard viewMode="patient" {...props} />
```

## üìà Performance Considerations
