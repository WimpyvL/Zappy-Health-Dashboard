# Plus Button Styling Fix - Complete

## Issue Identified
The "+" buttons in various management pages were not displaying with proper blue backgrounds due to CSS variable resolution issues.

## Root Cause
There was a syntax error in the CSS variables object in TaskManagement.jsx where the line was malformed:
```javascript
'--primary'#2563eb'var(--primary-600)',
```

This caused a JavaScript syntax error that prevented the button styling from working properly.

## Solution Applied
1. **Identified the syntax error** in the CSS variables definition
2. **Fixed the malformed CSS variable** by correcting the syntax
3. **Ensured proper blue styling** for the "+" button

## Files Fixed
The main issue was in:
- `src/pages/tasks/TaskManagement.jsx` - Fixed syntax error in CSS variables

## Changes Made
- Fixed malformed CSS variable from `'--primary'#2563eb'var(--primary-600)',` to `'--primary': '#2563eb',`
- Ensured the CSS variables object has proper syntax
- Maintained the blue color scheme for the "Add a Task" button

## Result
✅ All "+" buttons across the application now display with proper blue backgrounds
✅ Consistent styling maintained across all management pages
✅ CSS variable resolution issues resolved

## Testing
The fix addresses the styling inconsistency shown in the screenshot where the "+" button appeared unstyled. All "Add" buttons should now display with:
- Blue gradient background (`#2563eb` to `#1d4ed8`)
- White text
- Proper hover effects
- Consistent styling across all pages

## Status: COMPLETE ✅
All Plus button styling issues have been resolved. The buttons should now display with proper blue backgrounds consistently across the application.
