# Telehealth Application Migration Strategy and Timeline

This document outlines the strategy and a high-level timeline for migrating from the existing telehealth application to the rewritten version. Given the stated issues (deprecated files, communication errors, inconsistent styling), a phased "rewrite and replace" approach is recommended, prioritizing core functionalities.

## 1. Migration Principles

*   **Minimize Downtime**: Aim for near-zero downtime for critical patient-facing services.
*   **Data Integrity**: Ensure all existing patient data is migrated accurately and securely.
*   **Phased Rollout**: Introduce new functionalities incrementally to reduce risk and gather feedback.
*   **Automated Testing**: Comprehensive testing at each phase to ensure stability and correctness.
*   **Backward Compatibility**: Where feasible, maintain compatibility with existing data structures during transition.
*   **Rollback Plan**: Have a clear plan to revert to the old system if critical issues arise.
*   **Communication**: Keep stakeholders informed throughout the migration process.

## 2. Migration Strategy: Phased Rewrite and Replace

Instead of a "big bang" rewrite, a phased approach allows for continuous delivery and risk mitigation. The core idea is to build the new system in parallel and gradually switch over components or entire modules.

### Phase 0: Planning & Setup (Current State)

*   **Objective**: Establish foundational architecture, tooling, and development environment for the new application.
*   **Activities**:
    *   Finalize architecture, technology stack, data models, and flow diagrams (completed).
    *   Set up new Git repository and CI/CD pipelines.
    *   Provision new Supabase project (or prepare existing for major schema changes).
    *   Establish development, staging, and production environments.
    *   Set up comprehensive monitoring and logging for both old and new systems.
*   **Deliverables**: Architecture documentation, empty new codebase, configured environments.
*   **Timeline**: 2-4 weeks (already in progress/completed with current task).

### Phase 1: Core Platform & Authentication

*   **Objective**: Rebuild the core user authentication, profile management, and foundational application structure.
*   **Activities**:
    *   Implement new React frontend with core layouts and navigation.
    *   Integrate Supabase Auth for user signup, login, and session management.
    *   Migrate `auth.users` and `profiles` data from old system to new Supabase project.
    *   Implement RLS policies for `profiles` table.
    *   Develop basic dashboard views for both patient and admin roles.
    *   Set up initial CI/CD for frontend and basic backend (Edge Functions).
*   **Deliverables**: Functional login/signup, user profiles, basic dashboards.
*   **Timeline**: 4-6 weeks.

### Phase 2: Patient Management & Core Data

*   **Objective**: Migrate and rebuild patient management features, including patient profiles, basic health data, and document management.
*   **Activities**:
    *   Migrate `patients` table data.
    *   Implement patient list and detail views.
    *   Integrate Supabase Storage for patient documents.
    *   Develop document upload/viewing functionality.
    *   Migrate existing patient documents to new Supabase Storage buckets.
    *   Implement RLS for `patients` and `patient_documents`.
*   **Deliverables**: Fully functional patient profiles, document management.
*   **Timeline**: 6-8 weeks.

### Phase 3: Forms & Intake Flows

*   **Objective**: Rebuild the dynamic forms and patient intake processes.
*   **Activities**:
    *   Migrate `questionnaire`, `questionnaire_versions`, and `form_submissions` data.
    *   Implement dynamic form rendering using the new `questionnaire` schema.
    *   Develop form submission and validation logic.
    *   Integrate `enhanced_telehealth_flows` to track patient journey through forms.
    *   Implement RLS for form-related tables.
*   **Deliverables**: Functional patient intake forms, form submission tracking.
*   **Timeline**: 6-8 weeks.

### Phase 4: Orders, Invoices & Payments

*   **Objective**: Migrate and rebuild the e-commerce, order, invoice, and payment processing systems.
*   **Activities**:
    *   Migrate `products`, `orders`, `order_items`, `invoices`, `subscriptions`, `discounts` data.
    *   Integrate Stripe for payment processing (one-time and recurring).
    *   Develop shopping cart and checkout flows.
    *   Implement order and invoice generation.
    *   Set up Stripe webhooks via Supabase Edge Functions.
    *   Implement RLS for order and invoice related tables.
*   **Deliverables**: Functional product catalog, shopping cart, checkout, order history, invoice management.
*   **Timeline**: 8-10 weeks.

### Phase 5: Consultations & Messaging

*   **Objective**: Rebuild the core telehealth consultation and real-time messaging features.
*   **Activities**:
    *   Migrate `consultations`, `sessions`, `messages`, `conversations` data.
    *   Implement consultation scheduling and management.
    *   Develop real-time messaging interface using Supabase Realtime.
    *   Integrate `note_templates` and `processed_templates` for consultation notes.
    *   Implement RLS for consultation and messaging tables.
*   **Deliverables**: Functional consultation scheduling, real-time chat, structured consultation notes.
*   **Timeline**: 8-10 weeks.

### Phase 6: AI, Integrations & Advanced Features

*   **Objective**: Integrate AI capabilities and external pharmacy/lab systems.
*   **Activities**:
    *   Integrate DeepSeek (or chosen LLM) for AI summaries and recommendations.
    *   Develop pharmacy integration for prescription fulfillment.
    *   Develop lab integration for test ordering and results.
    *   Implement advanced features like `product_recommendation_rules`, `bundle_optimization_history`.
    *   Migrate remaining smaller datasets (e.g., `tags`, `audit_logs`).
*   **Deliverables**: AI-powered features, external system integrations.
*   **Timeline**: 6-8 weeks.

### Phase 7: Optimization, Testing & Go-Live

*   **Objective**: Finalize testing, optimize performance, and deploy the complete new application to production.
*   **Activities**:
    *   Comprehensive end-to-end testing, performance testing, and security audits.
    *   Load testing and scalability validation.
    *   Final data migration sync.
    *   DNS cutover to the new frontend and API endpoints.
    *   User acceptance testing (UAT) with a small group of users.
    *   Post-launch monitoring and support.
*   **Deliverables**: Production-ready application, successful go-live.
*   **Timeline**: 4-6 weeks.

## 3. Overall Timeline Estimate

**Total Estimated Time**: Approximately 40-54 weeks (10-13.5 months).

This timeline is a high-level estimate and will depend on team size, resource availability, and unforeseen complexities. Each phase should have its own detailed project plan with specific tasks, owners, and deadlines. Regular communication and agile methodologies will be crucial for successful execution.
