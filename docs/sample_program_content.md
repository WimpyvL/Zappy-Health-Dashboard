# GLP-1 Weight Loss Program - Complete Content

## Week 1: Getting Started

### Understanding GLP-1: How Your Medication Works
**Reading Time: 4 minutes**

**What is GLP-1?**
GLP-1 (Glucagon-like peptide-1) is a hormone naturally produced in your small intestine. When you eat, your intestines release GLP-1 to help regulate blood sugar and appetite. However, natural GLP-1 breaks down quickly in your body—within just a few minutes.

**How GLP-1 Medications Work**
Your medication (like semaglutide or tirzepatide) is a synthetic version of GLP-1 that's been modified to last much longer in your body—up to a week with weekly injections.

1. **Slows Gastric Emptying**
   - Your stomach empties food more slowly into your small intestine
   - This keeps you feeling full longer after meals
   - You'll notice you get satisfied with smaller portions

2. **Reduces Appetite**
   - Acts on your brain's hunger centers
   - Decreases cravings and thoughts about food
   - You may find yourself naturally eating less

3. **Improves Blood Sugar Control**
   - Helps your pancreas release insulin when needed
   - Reduces sugar production by your liver
   - Leads to more stable energy levels

**What to Expect: Timeline of Effects**
- **First 24-48 Hours:** You may notice slight appetite reduction, some people experience mild nausea
- **Week 1-2:** Appetite suppression becomes more noticeable, you'll start feeling full sooner during meals
- **Week 3-4:** Full appetite suppression typically achieved, most side effects diminish
- **Week 4+:** Steady, sustainable weight loss (1-2 lbs/week), new eating patterns feel more natural

**Key Takeaways**
✓ Your medication mimics a natural hormone your body already makes
✓ It works by making you feel full sooner and reducing appetite
✓ Most people see full effects by week 3-4
✓ Individual responses vary—be patient with your body's adjustment
