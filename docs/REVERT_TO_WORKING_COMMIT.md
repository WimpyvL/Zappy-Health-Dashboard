# Revert to Working Commit 89c0b69

## Recommendation: Restore Working ComponentOverlay System

Since the ComponentOverlay system was working properly in commit 89c0b69 before the infinite loop issues were introduced, the best approach is to revert the component overlay files to that working state.

### üîÑ Files to Restore from Commit 89c0b69

1. **ComponentOverlay.jsx** - The main overlay component
2. **useComponentSelector.js** - The hook that's causing infinite loops
3. **ComponentSelectionInterface.jsx** - Related selection interface
4. **Any related CSS files** - Styling that worked with the original implementation

### üíª Git Commands to Restore

```bash
# Navigate to the repository
cd /path/to/Zappy-Dashboard

# Check current commit
git log --oneline -5

# Restore specific files from commit 89c0b69
git checkout 89c0b69 -- src/components/ai/ComponentOverlay.jsx
git checkout 89c0b69 -- src/hooks/useComponentSelector.js
git checkout 89c0b69 -- src/components/ai/ComponentSelectionInterface.jsx
git checkout 89c0b69 -- src/components/ai/ComponentOverlay.css

# If there are other related files, restore them too:
# git checkout 89c0b69 -- src/components/ai/
```

### üîç Alternative: View Working Files

If you want to see what the working files looked like first:

```bash
# View the ComponentOverlay from the working commit
git show 89c0b69:src/components/ai/ComponentOverlay.jsx

# View the useComponentSelector hook from the working commit  
git show 89c0b69:src/hooks/useComponentSelector.js

# View the commit details
git show 89c0b69 --name-only
```

### üìã Steps to Implement

1. **Backup Current Files** (optional):
   ```bash
   cp src/components/ai/ComponentOverlay.jsx src/components/ai/ComponentOverlay.jsx.backup
   cp src/hooks/useComponentSelector.js src/hooks/useComponentSelector.js.backup
   ```

2. **Restore Working Files**:
   ```bash
   git checkout 89c0b69 -- src/components/ai/ComponentOverlay.jsx
   git checkout 89c0b69 -- src/hooks/useComponentSelector.js
   git checkout 89c0b69 -- src/components/ai/ComponentSelectionInterface.jsx
   ```

3. **Test the System**:
   - Start the development server
   - Test the AI component overlay functionality
   - Verify no infinite loops occur

4. **Commit the Restoration**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Restore working ComponentOverlay system from commit 89c0b69"
   ```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- This will overwrite the current problematic versions with the working versions
- Any improvements made after commit 89c0b69 will need to be carefully re-applied
- The circular reference fixes we implemented should still be preserved in other files
- Test thoroughly to ensure the infinite loop issue is resolved

### üéØ Expected Results

After restoring from commit 89c0b69:
- ‚úÖ ComponentOverlay should work without infinite loops
- ‚úÖ Component selection and analysis should function properly  
- ‚úÖ No "Maximum update depth exceeded" warnings
- ‚úÖ Stable performance and responsive UI
