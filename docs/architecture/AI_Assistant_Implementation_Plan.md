# AI Assistant System Implementation Plan

## Objective

Implement an AI assistant system with comprehensive codebase awareness and visual component identification capabilities, integrated with the existing AI-Overseer infrastructure.

---

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Visual Component Identification Interface

- **Location:** `src/components/ai/AIInformant.tsx` (extend existing UI)
- **Tasks:**
  - Add a toggle button to activate/deactivate "Component Identification Mode."
  - When active, overlay visual highlights on all selectable components (buttons, forms, containers, functions, classes).
  - Use DOM queries and CSS overlays for highlighting.
  - Capture user clicks/selections on highlighted components.
  - Extract detailed metadata (DOM attributes, component names, code references).
  - Send selection data to backend AIInformantService for analysis.

- **Considerations:**
  - Ensure minimal performance impact.
  - Accessibility for keyboard navigation and screen readers.
  - Clear visual feedback for selection.

### 2. Contextual Analysis Engine Enhancements

- **Location:** `src/services/ai-overseer/informant.ts` (AIInformantService)
- **Tasks:**
  - Add methods to accept explicit component selection data.
  - Perform detailed contextual analysis:
    - Map component dependencies using codebase context.
    - Analyze change impact on related components and modules.
  - Integrate with existing DOM scanning and page context detection.
  - Provide structured context output for prompt generation.

- **Considerations:**
  - Cache analysis results for performance.
  - Sanitize and validate input data.
  - Modular design for extensibility.

### 3. Developer Prompt Generator

- **Location:** `src/services/ai-overseer/deepseek.ts` (DeepSeekService) or new module
- **Tasks:**
  - Extend prompt generation to include:
    - Technical specifications of selected components.
    - Code optimization suggestions.
    - Accessibility enhancements.
    - Performance recommendations.
    - Architectural improvement advice.
  - Format output as structured developer-ready prompts with:
    - Implementation steps.
    - Code examples.
    - Best practices.
  - Support multiple output formats (markdown, JSON).

- **Considerations:**
  - Maintain up-to-date system knowledge.
  - Handle unknown or ambiguous cases gracefully.
  - Ensure prompt clarity and conciseness.

### 4. Integration Layer

- **Location:** Frontend-backend communication layer
- **Tasks:**
  - Define API endpoints or service interfaces for:
    - Sending component selection data.
    - Receiving structured developer prompts.
  - Manage session and context state.
  - Handle errors and retries.
  - Secure communication channels.

- **Considerations:**
  - Use REST or WebSocket APIs.
  - Authenticate and authorize requests.
  - Log interactions for monitoring and debugging.

## Milestones

1. **M1:** UI toggle and visual highlighting for component identification.
2. **M2:** Backend support for explicit component selection and contextual analysis.
3. **M3:** Enhanced prompt generation with structured developer prompts.
4. **M4:** End-to-end integration and testing.
5. **M5:** Documentation and developer onboarding materials.

## Quality and Security

- Write unit and integration tests for new UI and backend modules.
- Perform security audits on data handling and API endpoints.
- Ensure compliance with data privacy and access control policies.
- Optimize for performance and scalability.

---

## Future Enhancements

- IDE plugin integration for inline AI assistance.
- Multi-language codebase support.
- Collaborative team features.
- Advanced impact simulation and change visualization.
