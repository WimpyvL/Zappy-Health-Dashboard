# AI Assistant System Architecture

## Overview

This system provides an AI-powered assistant integrated into the development environment with comprehensive codebase awareness and visual component identification capabilities. It enables developers to select any UI or code component and receive detailed, actionable prompts for improvements, optimizations, and implementation guidance.

## Components

### 1. Visual Component Identification Interface

- **Location:** Frontend React component (e.g., `src/components/ai/ComponentIdentifier.tsx`)
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Toggle activation of component identification mode.
  - Visually highlight UI components (buttons, forms, containers, functions, classes, modules).
  - Allow user to select any component.
  - Capture component metadata (DOM attributes, code references).
  - Send selection data to backend services for analysis.

- **Scalability & Maintainability:**
  - Modular React component with clear props and state management.
  - Use efficient event delegation and minimal DOM manipulation.
  - Support extensibility for new component types.

- **Security:**
  - Sanitize all user inputs and component metadata.
  - Limit access to authorized users/developers.

### 2. Contextual Analysis Engine

- **Location:** Backend service within `AIInformantService` (`src/services/ai-overseer/informant.ts`)
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Receive component selection data.
  - Analyze component in the context of the codebase.
  - Map dependencies and relationships using codebase context.
  - Enhance context with DOM and code metadata.
  - Provide structured context for prompt generation.

- **Scalability & Maintainability:**
  - Use caching for repeated analyses.
  - Modular functions for different component types.
  - Clear interfaces for integration with other services.

- **Security:**
  - Validate and sanitize incoming data.
  - Ensure no leakage of sensitive codebase information.

### 3. Developer Prompt Generator

- **Location:** Backend service, leveraging `DeepSeekService` (`src/services/ai-overseer/deepseek.ts`)
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Generate detailed developer prompts based on contextual analysis.
  - Include technical specifications, code optimization suggestions, accessibility enhancements.
  - Provide performance and architectural improvement recommendations.
  - Output structured, developer-ready prompts with implementation steps and code examples.

- **Scalability & Maintainability:**
  - Use template-driven prompt generation.
  - Support multiple output formats (markdown, JSON).
  - Easily extendable with new prompt types.

- **Security:**
  - Sanitize generated content.
  - Avoid exposing sensitive internal details.

### 4. Integration Layer

- **Location:** Backend API endpoints and frontend service connectors.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Connect frontend interface with backend services.
  - Manage session and context state.
  - Handle communication and error handling.

- **Scalability & Maintainability:**
  - Use REST or WebSocket APIs.
  - Stateless backend services where possible.
  - Robust error handling and logging.

- **Security:**
  - Authenticate and authorize API requests.
  - Use secure communication channels (HTTPS, WebSocket Secure).

## Data Flow

1. Developer activates the Visual Component Identification Interface.
2. Developer selects a UI or code component.
3. Component metadata is sent to the Contextual Analysis Engine.
4. Contextual Analysis Engine enriches data with codebase context and dependencies.
5. Developer Prompt Generator creates structured, actionable prompts.
6. Prompts are sent back to the frontend and displayed to the developer.

## Critical Flows and Failure Modes

- **Component Selection Failure:** UI fails to capture or send component data.
  - Mitigation: Graceful error messages, retry mechanisms.

- **Contextual Analysis Errors:** Incomplete or incorrect context due to codebase changes.
  - Mitigation: Cache invalidation, fallback to partial analysis.

- **Prompt Generation Issues:** AI service errors or irrelevant suggestions.
  - Mitigation: Validation of AI responses, user feedback loop.

- **Security Breaches:** Unauthorized access to codebase or AI services.
  - Mitigation: Strict authentication, input/output sanitization.

## Scalability Considerations

- Modular services allow independent scaling.
- Caching of analysis results reduces load.
- Asynchronous processing for heavy AI computations.
- Frontend optimized for minimal performance impact.

## Maintainability Considerations

- Clear separation of concerns.
- Well-documented APIs and interfaces.
- Automated tests for UI and backend services.
- Continuous integration and deployment pipelines.

## Security Considerations

- Secure storage and transmission of codebase data.
- Role-based access control for AI assistant features.
- Regular security audits and dependency updates.

## Future Enhancements

- Support for multi-language codebases.
- Integration with IDEs for inline suggestions.
- Collaborative features for team-based code reviews.
- Advanced impact analysis with change simulations.
