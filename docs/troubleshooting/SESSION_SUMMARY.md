-# Session Summary

This document summarizes the key activities, decisions, and code changes made during the chat session.

## 1. Initial Codebase Analysis

*   Analyzed `package.json` to identify core technologies: React, Ant Design, Tailwind CSS, TanStack Query, React Router, Axios, React Hook Form.
*   Examined `src/index.js`, `src/App.js`, `src/constants/AppRoutes.jsx`, and `src/layouts/MainLayout.jsx` to understand application structure, routing, context providers (`AuthContext`, `AppContext`, `CartContext`), and main layout.
*   Reviewed `src/utils/apiService.js` to understand API interaction patterns, including Axios setup and JWT token refresh logic.
*   Determined the codebase represents an **admin dashboard**, not the client-facing application.

## 2. Admin/Patient View Simulation

*   Added state (`viewMode`) and a setter function (`setViewMode`) to `AppContext.jsx`.
*   Initially added a toggle switch, later replaced with an Ant Design `Dropdown` in `src/layouts/components/Headers.js` to switch between 'admin' and 'patient' views.
*   Modified `src/layouts/components/Sidebar.js` to conditionally render different navigation items based on the `viewMode`.

## 3. System Map Feature (Refactored from Automations)

*   Initially created an "Automations" page (`src/pages/automations/`) with React Flow integration for workflow building.
*   **Pivoted:** Changed the feature's purpose to visualizing system architecture and flows ("System Map").
*   **Renamed Components:**
    *   `AUTOMATION_FEATURE_TODO.md` -> `SYSTEM_MAP_FEATURE_TODO.md` (and updated content).
    *   `src/pages/automations/` directory -> `src/pages/system-map/`.
    *   `AutomationsPage.jsx` -> `SystemMapPage.jsx`.
    *   `AutomationSidebar.jsx` -> `SystemMapSidebar.jsx`.
    *   `TriggerNode.jsx` -> `InputNode.jsx`.
    *   `ActionNode.jsx` -> `DefaultNode.jsx`.
*   **Updated Sidebar:** `SystemMapSidebar.jsx` updated with elements relevant to system mapping (Page, Component, API, etc.) and passes specific type/icon info.
*   **Updated Custom Nodes:** `DefaultNode.jsx` and `InputNode.jsx` updated to display dynamic icons based on data passed from the sidebar.
*   **Node Details Display:** Implemented an Ant Design `Popover` on custom nodes (`DefaultNode`, `InputNode`) to show description and link details on click, replacing the previous sidebar/modal configuration approach.
*   **Configuration Panel:** Added fields for Description and Link to the node configuration logic (initially in a modal, now displayed via Popover).

## 4. Database & Backend Integration Setup

*   **Database Choice:** Discussed database options; **Managed PostgreSQL via Supabase** was selected for its balance of features, ease of management, and safety.
*   **Schema:** Analyzed provided `schema.sql`, confirmed its PostgreSQL compatibility, noted missing tables (`products`, `services`, etc.), and potential considerations (ID types, `user` table scope). Rewrote `schema.sql` to separate `CREATE TABLE` and `ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT` statements for easier direct execution in Supabase SQL Editor.
*   **TODO List:** Created `POSTGRES_SETUP_TODO.md` outlining steps for database setup, backend implementation, and frontend integration.
*   **Supabase Client Setup:**
    *   Installed `@supabase/supabase-js` package.
    *   Created `.env` file with `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL` and `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.
    *   Created `src/utils/supabaseClient.js` to initialize and export the Supabase client.
*   **Frontend Refactoring for Supabase:**
    *   Removed mock data and fetching logic from `AppContext.jsx`.
    *   Refactored `AuthContext.jsx` to use `supabase.auth` methods.
    *   Refactored React Query hooks in `src/apis/` for Patients, Orders, Sessions, Tags, Products, Services, Consultations, Notes, Forms, Tasks, Users, Audit Logs, Discounts, Invoices, Pharmacies, and Subscription Plans to use `supabaseClient.js` instead of mock data or `apiService.js`. Addressed various syntax errors during refactoring.
*   **Troubleshooting:** Addressed issues with Supabase environment variables not loading (required dev server restart) and Supabase CLI/Docker errors. Identified missing Row Level Security (RLS) policies as the likely cause of HTTP 406 errors during data fetching attempts.

## 5. Deployment Setup

*   Created `netlify.toml` file with build command (`npm run build`), publish directory (`build/`), and SPA redirect rule for Netlify deployment.

## Current Status

*   Frontend codebase is largely refactored to use Supabase for authentication and data fetching (via React Query hooks).
*   Mock data has been removed.
*   Configuration for Netlify deployment is in place.
*   System Map visualization tool foundation is built with React Flow, custom nodes, and popover details.

## Next Steps (User Actions Required)

*   Apply the database schema (`schema.sql`) to the Supabase project.
*   Create any missing tables (e.g., `products`, `services`, `consultations`, `notes`, `pharmacies`, `subscription_plans`, `insurance_records`, `insurance_documents`).
*   **Crucially, configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies** in Supabase for all relevant tables to allow data access.
*   Set Supabase environment variables in the Netlify deployment environment.
*   Review components using the refactored hooks for any necessary adjustments to handle Supabase data structures.
*   Consider removing `src/utils/apiService.js` if Supabase handles all backend needs.
*   Test the application thoroughly against the live Supabase backend.
