# Zappy Dashboard Codebase Restructuring Guide

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the codebase restructuring performed on May 1, 2025.

## Directory Structure Changes

1. **Consolidated Context Management**
   - Combined context/ and contexts/ into a single contexts/ directory
   - Organized contexts by domain (auth, app, cart, route)
   - Added an index.js for easy imports

2. **Improved Component Organization**
   - Reorganized components into:
     - common/: Truly common components used across the app
     - domain/: Domain-specific components that aren't full pages
     - ui/: Pure UI components with no business logic

3. **Standardized API Layer**
   - Ensured consistent structure in each API domain folder:
     - api.js: API endpoint definitions
     - hooks.js: Custom hooks using the API
     - types.js: TypeScript types for this domain
     - utils.js: Domain-specific utilities

4. **Consolidated Documentation**
   - Moved all documentation from Updated/ to a centralized docs/ folder
   - Organized documentation by category

5. **Standardized Hooks Organization**
   - Added an index.js to export all hooks

## Migration Challenges

- Some files may have been missed in the migration
- Import paths in existing files will need to be updated
- Tests may need to be updated to reflect new file locations

## Next Steps

1. Update import paths in all files
2. Run tests to identify and fix any issues
3. Remove old directories after confirming everything works
