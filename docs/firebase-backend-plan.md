# Firebase Backend Implementation Plan for HealthFlow

This document outlines a strategic plan for building a secure, scalable, and HIPAA-compliant backend for the HealthFlow application using Firebase services.

## 1. Core Firebase Services

We will leverage the following Firebase services:

*   **Cloud Firestore:** As the primary NoSQL database for storing structured patient data, consultations, appointments, and other application data. Its robust security rules are essential for HIPAA compliance.
*   **Firebase Storage:** For securely storing patient-related files such as medical records, lab results, and insurance documents.
*   **Firebase Realtime Database / Firestore Listeners:** To provide real-time updates for features like live chat, appointment status changes, and notifications.
*   **Cloud Functions for Firebase:** To run backend code for complex business logic, data validation, and creating audit trails, without exposing sensitive operations to the client.

## 2. Firestore Database for Patient Data (HIPAA Focus)

The cornerstone of our HIPAA compliance strategy is the secure structuring and access control of patient data in Firestore.

### **Data Structure Strategy:**

We will use separate top-level collections to isolate different data types. This prevents deep nesting and simplifies security rules.

*   **`/patients/{patientId}`:** Stores non-medical patient demographic data.
    *   `patientId` should be the same as the Firebase Auth `uid`.
*   **`/medical_records/{recordId}`:** Stores Protected Health Information (PHI).
    *   `patientId`: A reference to the patient this record belongs to.
    *   This collection will have the strictest security rules.
*   **`/appointments/{appointmentId}`:** Stores appointment details.
    *   `patientId`, `providerId`: References to the patient and provider involved.
*   **`/messages/{conversationId}/chats/{messageId}`:** Stores chat messages.
    *   Each conversation document will have a subcollection for its messages.
*   **`/audit_logs/{logId}`:** Stores logs for security and compliance.

### **HIPAA Compliance Strategy for Firestore:**

1.  **Access Control with Security Rules:** This is the most critical part. We will implement granular rules to ensure data isolation.
    *   A patient can only read/write their own data.
    *   A provider can only access data for patients they are assigned to.
    *   Admins have broader, but still logged, access.

    **Example Firestore Security Rule:**
    ```
    match /medical_records/{recordId} {
      // A user can only access a medical record if their UID matches the patientId on the record.
      allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.patientId;
    }
    ```

2.  **Data Minimization:** Only store the minimum necessary PHI. Avoid storing sensitive data like full credit card numbers.
3.  **Encryption:** Firebase automatically encrypts data at rest and in transit. No extra setup is needed for this baseline, but it's a key compliance feature.

## 3. Firebase Storage for Documents

### **Storage Strategy:**

*   **Structured Paths:** Files will be stored in paths that include the `patientId` to simplify access control rules. For example: `patient-documents/{patientId}/{documentId}.pdf`.
*   **Access Control with Storage Rules:** Similar to Firestore, we will use rules to control who can upload, download, or delete files.

    **Example Storage Security Rule:**
    ```
    match /b/{bucket}/o/patient-documents/{patientId}/{documentId} {
      // A user can only access files in their own folder.
      allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == patientId;
    }
    ```

## 4. Real-time Functionality

We will use Firestore's real-time listeners to update the UI instantly when database changes occur.

### **Implementation Strategy:**

*   **Client-Side Listeners:** The application will listen for changes to specific documents or collections.
    *   **Example Use Case:** A provider's dashboard could listen for new appointments being scheduled. When a new document appears in the `appointments` collection for that provider, their UI updates automatically.
*   **Secure Subscriptions:** Firestore security rules are automatically applied to real-time listeners, so users will only receive updates for data they are authorized to see.

## 5. Audit Trails with Cloud Functions

To ensure accountability and meet HIPAA requirements, we will create an audit trail for all significant events.

### **Implementation Strategy:**

*   **Cloud Function Triggers:** We'll write Cloud Functions that trigger on specific database events (e.g., creating, updating, or deleting a document in `medical_records`).
*   **Logging:** The function will log key information to the `/audit_logs` collection in Firestore.

    **Example Audit Log Entry:**
    ```json
    {
      "timestamp": "2023-10-27T10:00:00Z",
      "userId": "provider_abc",
      "action": "READ_MEDICAL_RECORD",
      "targetPatientId": "patient_xyz",
      "details": "Provider accessed patient's lab results."
    }
    ```

## 6. Implementation Plan & Timeline

### **Phase 1: Database Setup & Basic CRUD (1-2 Weeks)**
*   [ ] Finalize Firestore data models.
*   [ ] Set up initial Firestore security rules for patient data isolation.
*   [ ] Implement basic Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations for patient profiles.
*   [ ] Set up Firebase Storage with basic rules.

### **Phase 2: Core Features & Logic (2-3 Weeks)**
*   [ ] Implement appointment scheduling logic.
*   [ ] Build out the secure document upload/download functionality.
*   [ ] Create Cloud Functions for audit logging on critical data access.

### **Phase 3: Real-time Features & Polish (1-2 Weeks)**
*   [ ] Integrate Firestore listeners for real-time dashboard updates.
*   [ ] Implement real-time messaging.
*   [ ] Refine security rules and conduct a security review.

### **Important Prerequisite:**
*   For HIPAA compliance, you must sign a **Business Associate Agreement (BAA)** with Google Cloud Platform, as Firebase is a GCP service. This is a legal requirement.
