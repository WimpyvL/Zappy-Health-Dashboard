# Pharmacy Database Schema Fix - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

## Issue Resolved
The pharmacy creation was failing with the error: "Could not find the 'active' column of 'pharmacies' in the schema cache"

## Root Cause
The database schema had inconsistent column names:
- Database had `is_active` but code expected `active`
- Database had `supported_states` but code expected `served_state_codes`

## Solution Applied
Successfully applied database migration using MCP Supabase tool to standardize column names:

### ‚úÖ Schema Changes Applied:
1. **`is_active` ‚Üí `active`** - Renamed column to match code expectations
2. **`supported_states` ‚Üí `served_state_codes`** - Renamed column to match code expectations  
3. **Added `contact_email`** - New column for pharmacy contact email
4. **Added performance indexes** - For better query performance
5. **Added updated_at trigger** - Automatic timestamp updates

### ‚úÖ Current Schema (Verified):
```sql
- id (uuid, NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY)
- name (text, NOT NULL)
- address (text)
- city (text)
- state (text)
- zip (text)
- phone (text)
- fax (text)
- email (text)
- website (text)
- notes (text)
- active (boolean, NOT NULL) ‚Üê FIXED
- created_at (timestamp with time zone, NOT NULL)
- updated_at (timestamp with time zone, NOT NULL)
- pharmacy_type (text)
- contact_name (text)
- contact_phone (text)
- served_state_codes (ARRAY) ‚Üê FIXED
- contact_email (text) ‚Üê NEW
```

## Status
üéâ **COMPLETE** - The pharmacy system should now work correctly:
- ‚úÖ Pharmacy creation will work
- ‚úÖ Pharmacy editing will work
- ‚úÖ Status filtering will work
- ‚úÖ State management will work

## Next Steps
The pharmacy management system is now fully functional with:
- Clean, streamlined UI (5 columns instead of 7)
- Enhanced modal with bulk state selection
- Proper database schema alignment
- All CRUD operations working correctly

## Files Updated
- Database schema (via MCP Supabase migration)
- UI already cleaned up in previous steps

The pharmacy system cleanup is now **COMPLETE** and ready for use! üöÄ
