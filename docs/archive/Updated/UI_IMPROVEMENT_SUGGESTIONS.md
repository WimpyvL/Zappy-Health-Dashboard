# UI Improvement Suggestions

After reviewing the four main pages (HomePageV2, ProgramsPage, ShopPage, PatientServicesPageV3), here are suggestions for improving color consistency, readability, and overall coherence.

## Color Consistency

### Status Colors
- **Success Green (#10b981)**: Used for success states and "Done" badges
- **Suggestion**: Create a consistent set of status colors for all badges:
  - Success: #10b981 (green)
  - Warning: #f59e0b (amber)
  - Info: #2D7FF9 (blue)
  - Error: #ef4444 (red)
