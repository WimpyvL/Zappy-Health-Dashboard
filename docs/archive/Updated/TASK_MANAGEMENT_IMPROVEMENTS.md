# Task Management Improvements

## Overview

The task management system has been simplified and improved to focus on the core functionality of assigning tasks between team members. The new implementation provides a cleaner, more intuitive interface with two main views:

1. **My Tasks** - Tasks assigned to the current user
2. **Assigned by Me** - Tasks created by the current user and assigned to others

## Key Changes

### Database Changes

- Added `created_by` column to track who created each task
- Converted the `status` field to use an enum type with values: 'pending', 'in_progress', 'completed', 'cancelled'
- Added indexes on `created_by` and `user_id` columns for better performance

### UI Improvements

- Added tab navigation to switch between "My Tasks" and "Assigned by Me" views
- Simplified the task list to show the most important information
- Added quick action buttons for completing, editing, and deleting tasks
- Maintained search functionality for finding tasks by title
- Kept status filter alongside search for easy filtering
- Improved the visual design with clearer status indicators and better spacing

### Task Modal Improvements

- Simplified the task creation/editing form to focus on essential fields:
  - Reordered fields to put "Assign To" first for better workflow
  - Changed "Task Title" to just "Task" for simplicity
  - Converted task input to a multi-line textarea for longer task descriptions
  - Removed status selection (tasks are created with 'pending' status by default)
  - Changed date input to date-only (removed time component)
  - Removed notes/message field for ultra-minimal interface
  - Removed priority, reminder date, and duration fields
- Improved the assignee selection interface:
  - Added searchable dropdown for finding assignees quickly
  - Completely removed the container box when no assignees are found
  - Only shows "No assignees found" message when actively searching
  - Eliminated all empty space and borders when no results are displayed

### API Improvements

- Added dedicated hooks for fetching "My Tasks" and "Tasks I Assigned"
- Added a hook to get the current user ID
- Improved error handling and loading states
- Optimized data fetching to reduce unnecessary requests

## How to Use

### Viewing Tasks

1. Navigate to the Tasks page
2. Use the tabs at the top to switch between "My Tasks" and "Assigned by Me" views
3. Use the search box to find specific tasks
4. Use the status filter to show tasks with a specific status

### Creating Tasks

1. Click the "Add Task" button
2. Select an assignee from the dropdown (search by name if needed)
3. Enter the task description in the textarea
4. Optionally set a due date
5. Click "Create Task"

### Managing Tasks

- Click "Complete" to mark a task as completed
- Click "Edit" to modify a task
- Click "Delete" to remove a task

## Technical Implementation

The implementation uses React Query for data fetching and state management, with Supabase as the backend. The main components are:

- `TaskManagement.js` - The main page component
- `TaskModal.jsx` - The modal for creating and editing tasks
- `hooks.js` - API hooks for interacting with the backend

## Migration

A migration script has been provided to update the database schema:

```bash
# Run the migration script
./apply-tasks-migration.sh
```

This will add the necessary columns and indexes to the tasks table.
