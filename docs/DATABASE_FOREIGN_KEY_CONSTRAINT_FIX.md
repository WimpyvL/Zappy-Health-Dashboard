# Database Foreign Key Constraint Fix

## Issue Description
Error: "Failed to submit form: Form submission failed: insert or update on table "form_submissions" violates foreign key constraint "form_submissions_patient_id_fkey" | Details: Key (patient_id)=(e45f0da3-569a-4397-9bc8-927b0ed3cf64) is not present in table "patients". | Code: 23503"

## Root Cause Analysis
The error indicates that:
1. A form submission is trying to reference a patient_id that doesn't exist in the patients table
2. The foreign key constraint `form_submissions_patient_id_fkey` is enforcing referential integrity
3. Patient ID `e45f0da3-569a-4397-9bc8-927b0ed3cf64` is missing from the patients table

## Potential Causes
1. Patient record was deleted but form submissions still reference it
2. Data inconsistency between tables
3. Race condition during patient creation/form submission
4. Migration issues that left orphaned references

## Solution Strategy
1. Check for orphaned form submissions
2. Clean up invalid references
3. Add proper error handling for missing patient references
4. Implement cascade delete or set null policies

## Implementation Plan
1. Create a migration to fix existing data inconsistencies
2. Update foreign key constraints with proper cascade behavior
3. Add validation in form submission logic
4. Implement proper error handling
